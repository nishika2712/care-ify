    <h1>Reduce stress using these 3 methods!</h1>
    <div id="blogg">
      <article id="blogmaterial">
        It’s been a tough few weeks. Our hospitals have become overwhelmed with
        COVID-19 patients, and deaths rates are rising. Vaccine distribution has
        been slower than we had hoped. And then there was the chaotic,
        disturbing event at the Capitol. On top of all of that, there are the
        daily questions: How can I stay safe? When will I be able to see my
        family and friends? How long till we get back to normal?
        <br />
        <br />
        Any of the issues, alone, would stress us out -- but right now,
        everything seems to be happening at once. The question is, how do we
        stay sane and grounded at this time? And how do we help our families do
        the same? I rely on three simple daily rituals to help myself stay calm
        during challenging times.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Set my intention.</em> The first thing I do every morning, before I
        even get my coffee, is to think about my intention for the day. What
        will be my "main theme" of the day? Aiming my focus like this not only
        helps me prioritize, but it also puts me at the steering wheel. Often it
        can feel like life is dragging us around, but setting an intention like
        this can help us have control over what we want to do with the day that
        is given to us. Your intention might be to focus on your job and make a
        dent in a project, or perhaps it's self-care and making calls for
        doctors' appointments. Recently, my intentions have been to make
        progress on a project at work and to be present for my kids. Having a
        focus or intention helps me have a North Star for the day so I don’t get
        stuck mentally.

        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Move my body.</em> My second daily task is to find 15-30 minutes for
        physical activity, preferably outdoors. This is because exercise is not
        only good for our physical health, but it can help our mental and
        emotional well-being too. If you can do it outside and be in the sun,
        that is definitely a bonus -- sunshine is thought to release serotonin,
        a hormone that helps mood and focus. Taking a break from your work for
        even a 15-minute walk can leave you more energized, ultimately helping
        your mood and productivity. I often go on my stationary bike just for 15
        minutes with my fave play list, and I can feel a boost from it.

        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Practice gratitude.</em> My third ritual is at the end of the day.
        And this is to take a moment and just list 1-2 things that I am truly
        grateful for. I try to be as specific as possible -- this takes more
        thought, and I find that the extra effort pays off. Think about what it
        is and why you are grateful for it. For example, yesterday, I was very
        grateful for my room. That sounds trivial, but it isn’t -- my room feels
        like a sanctuary to me, a space where I can think and be creative.
        Feeling grateful for your home, family, health, or a friend helps us
        shift from stressed out and negative to a more positive perspective. And
        this can help our emotional stress levels, especially during this
        pandemic.

        <br />
        <br />
        If you’ve tried habits like these but your stress level still seems
        really high, it is important to reach out for help. It could be your
        family or a friend, but sometimes you might need professional help, so
        consider seeing a therapist. Many are conducting therapy via
        tele-appointments. There are also a variety of apps, teletherapy, and
        even SMS texting such as Talkspace, Woebot, and Crisis Text Line that
        are literally at your fingertips. Make sure you use these tools, and
        reach out to your doctor if you need to.
