    <h1>Are vaccinations enough?</h1>
    <div id="blogg">
      <article id="blogmaterial">
        It has been almost 10 months since life got “locked down” due to
        COVID-19. This new normal has not been easy for anyone. Being
        significantly restricted in our daily lives, wearing masks, hearing bad
        news about the pandemic constantly, and working from home has changed
        how we live our lives. And then there are some of us who have been
        devastated: We may have gotten sick, suffered financial hardship, or
        lost someone in our family to COVID. And the social isolation we’ve all
        had to endure has had a deep impact on our mental health.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have felt the social isolation personally. I am very close to my
        family, but they all live far away. As a recently transitioned single
        parent, it has been hard -- I need my sisters and parents now more than
        ever. I had hoped to travel by air to see them over the holidays --
        first at Thanksgiving, then over Christmas -- but I knew I needed to
        cancel it. Because the risk of COVID is real, spread happens when we are
        gathered indoors, and the hospitals are overwhelmed already.
        <br />
        <br />
        In many states, ICUs and ERs are overflowing. There aren’t enough beds,
        and there aren’t even enough health care workers. They are exhausted and
        there are just too many shifts to cover, too many patients needing care.
        My colleagues who are nurses and doctors in Atlanta have been fighting
        the battles at the frontlines -- masked, shielded more than 8 hours at a
        time, and ready to help, even as tired as they are. It is hot to wear
        that gear, and scary to step into a room where a patient can’t breathe
        because of COVID. These men and women, after a long shift, take off that
        protective equipment and go home to their families, hoping they won’t
        expose their children or spouses.
        <br />
        <br />
        And overflowing hospitals can affect us even when we don’t have COVID.
        when the ERs and ICUs are overwhelmed with COVID cases, and the doctors
        and nurses have worked too many extra shifts, people coming in with
        other sicknesses may not get the care they need. What happens when you
        get sick with “normal” ailments, such as a broken ankle or an asthma
        attack? What happens if your mom or dad has a heart attack and needs to
        go into the ER?
        <br />
        <br />
        COVID is ravaging our health system -- it’s taking out patients and our
        frontline workers. It is now the worst it’s been, but here’s the thing:
        We do have a light at the end of the tunnel. The vaccines are coming. In
        some countries, they will start giving the vaccine this month, and we in
        the U.S. will have access to them in the next few months. It will be the
        beginning of the end of this pandemic. It’s not far away. So who would
        want to get sick now?
        <br />
        <br />
        We need to buckle down, stay home, and wear masks to protect ourselves
        and to salvage our hospitals and our health care workers. This is
        everyone’s responsibility. It may change the way we celebrate the
        holidays, but there are still ways to enjoy the season.
