    <h1>What Is a Pulse Oximeter?</h1>
    <div id="blogg">
      <article id="blogmaterial">
        Many doctors in emergency rooms are noticing a very concerning finding:
        Some COVID-19 patients have dangerously low levels of oxygen, but appear
        completely comfortable. This is being called “silent hypoxia.” While
        other conditions can cause silent hypoxia, the number of people with
        COVID-19 presenting this way is making some doctors rethink how we
        manage COVID-19 patients before they need emergency care.

        <br />
        <br />
        Some are recommending that COVID-19 patients monitor their oxygen levels
        at home with a pulse oximeter. A pulse oximeter is a small device that
        clips onto your finger and measures the oxygen in your blood. After
        placing the clip on your finger, you get a heart rate reading and blood
        oxygen level reading (it’s a little more complicated than this – what
        you are actually getting is a percentage of the oxygen saturation in
        your blood…. but you get the point).

        <br />
        <br />
        A normal oxygen level measured by a pulse oximeter is around 97%, unless
        you have other underlying health problems like COPD. Doctors start to
        worry when this level drops under 90% because this can affect the amount
        of oxygen going to your brain and other vital organs. People can
        experience confusion and lethargy at low levels. Levels below 80% are
        considered dangerous and increase the risk of organ damage.

        <br />
        <br />
        The oxygen level in your blood depends on multiple factors. It depends
        on the amount of oxygen in the air you breathe in and the ability of
        that oxygen to make it across tiny air sacs at the very ends of the lung
        into the blood stream. With COVID-19 patients, we know that the virus
        can damage the tiny air sacs allowing them to fill up with fluid,
        inflammatory cells and other material that can block the flow of oxygen
        into the blood.

        <br />
        <br />
        Usually, people with low oxygen levels appear uncomfortable, sometimes
        even to the point of appearing to be gasping for air. This can happen if
        the windpipe is blocked or if too much carbon dioxide builds up in the
        blood triggering your body’s response to breathe faster to breathe it
        out.

        <br />
        <br />
        It’s not really clear why some COVID-19 patients have such low levels of
        oxygen without appearing uncomfortable. Some experts think it has to do
        with damage to the blood vessels in the lungs. Normally, when parts of
        the lung are damaged, blood vessels constrict (or get smaller) to force
        blood to go to areas of the lung that are not damaged, keeping up the
        oxygen levels. With COVID-19, this response may not be working, so blood
        flow continues even to areas with damaged lung, where oxygen can’t make
        it across to the blood stream. There’s also the newer finding of
        “microthrombi” or tiny blood clots that can block oxygen flow into the
        blood vessels in the lungs which may be causing the drop in oxygen
        levels.

        <br />
        <br />
        Doctors are divided on whether home monitoring of oxygen levels with a
        pulse oximeter may help because we don’t have clear evidence that is can
        make a difference in the outcome. In a recent opinion piece for The New
        York Times, one ER doctor recommended home monitoring for patients with
        COVID-19 because they believed that information about oxygen levels may
        help some people seek care earlier if their oxygen level begins to drop.
